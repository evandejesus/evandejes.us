intro: |
  I am a software developer and cloud engineer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. I focus on building and managing infrastructure for high performance cloud-native applications. I am certified as an AWS architect and Kubernetes Application Developer, and I leverage these skills to build robust production websites.

  I am currently a cloud engineer for <a href="chess.com">Chess.com</a>.

  Prior to this, I worked as a software developer / devops engineer for <a href="24g.com">24G</a> where I built digital experiences for clients including the New York Times, Google, Porsche, Volkswagen, and more.
